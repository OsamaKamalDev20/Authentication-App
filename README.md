 # 🔒 🔓  Authentication App  🔒 🔓 
An authentication app is software designed to provide an additional layer of security for user accounts by generating time-based, one-time passwords (TOTPs) or verification codes. These codes are used alongside traditional passwords to verify users' identities during the login process, ensuring enhanced protection against unauthorized access.
